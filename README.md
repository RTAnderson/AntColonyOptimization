# Ant Colony Optimization Script

A Clojure library that uses an ant colony optimization algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.  In the current iteration, a random set of waypoints is generated and the algorithm algorithm will conduct n tours and return a (non-convergent) shortest round trip path that touches each of the waypoints.

Script is in a very early stage and more thorough documentation will be available in the coming weeks. Unit tests are still being developed to verify the algorithm is properly implemented.(Cursory sanity checks show the algorithm functions as expected. ie: with each tour the selected path is being driven to a local minimum.)
